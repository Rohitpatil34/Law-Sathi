## 🚨 Problem Statement

Legal education in India is hindered by the complexity of acts, clauses, and legal language, making it difficult for students and the general public to comprehend. Most platforms lack categorization, contextual examples, and practice-based learning tools.

### Why It Matters

- Legal texts are hard to interpret without legal training.  
- There’s no unified, student-friendly legal learning platform.  
- Simplification is essential for both legal literacy and academic success.
